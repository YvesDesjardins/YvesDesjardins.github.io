    This was a single page app built in <mark>ReactJS</mark> to emulate a Slack style chat program. I have implemented the use of hooks into this project in order to get more exposure to this new addition. I also utilized <mark>WebSockets</mark> for communication between the back-end server and any clients who have connected. <mark>JSX</mark> was also heavily utilized to correctly build the elements and have them display correctly to clients.
