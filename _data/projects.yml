    This project was worked on by myself and two other students with the intent being to build a single page "smart" todo list. I was responsible for building out the back-end of the project along with the database. Through this experience I have further developed my knowledge of proper <mark>Git</mark> usage in groups, <mark>postgreSQL</mark> and routing in <mark>Express</mark>.
